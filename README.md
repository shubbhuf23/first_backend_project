# first_backend_project
This is my first backend project while I have been learning node.js and express.js. This might be most simple project because this is my first project made. In this project, I have made a CRUD API using Node.js and Express.js. I have to make http://localhost:3000/api/genre in which I should have to give an option to Create, Read, Update and Delete a genre. That's all.

I used the following modules:
- express@4.17.1
- joi@13.1.0
